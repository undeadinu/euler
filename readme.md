# Solutions to Project Euler in Go [![Thanks](https://img.shields.io/badge/Say%20Thanks-💗-ff69b4.svg)](https://www.patreon.com/nikitavoloboev)

## Description 📕
I want to complete as many of the problems from Project Euler as I can as I find math fascinating and implementing algorithms is quite fun.
 

## Problems
| number | problem | solution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Multiples of 3 and 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) | [code](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/go-euler/blob/master/problems/001-multiples-of-3-and-5/001-multiples-of-3-and-5.go) |
| 2 | [Even Fibonacci Numbers](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) | [code](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/go-euler/blob/master/problems/002-even-fibonacci-numbers/002-even-fibonacci-numbers.go) |
